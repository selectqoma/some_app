# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command

# use logrotate for ROS log files
* */1 * * * logrotate -vf /home/kpv/catkin_ws/src/smelter-monitoring/logrotation/logrotate_ros.conf

# delete ros logs older than 15 days
# * */1 * * * find /home/kpv/.ros -type d,f -path "/home/kpv/.ros/bags" -prune -mtime +15 -o -exec rm -r {} \;

# use custom script for rosbags - maximum allowed size is 260GB, 128GB for cascade, 128GB for slagsquare, 10GB for slagsquare fff frames
